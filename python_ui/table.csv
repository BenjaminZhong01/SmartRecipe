0,coconut-red-lentil-soup-recipe,1.0,236.6,/ 7 oz / 200g yellow split peas,37.46,"Give the split peas and lentils a good rinse - until they no longer put off murky water. Place them in an extra-large soup pot, cover with the water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and add the carrot and 1/4 of the ginger. Cover and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the split peas are soft. In the meantime, in a small dry skillet or saucepan over low heat, toast the curry powder until it is quite fragrant. Be careful though, you don't want to burn the curry powder, just toast it. Set aside. Place the butter in a pan over medium heat, add half of the green onions, the remaining ginger, and raisins. Saute for two minutes stirring constantly, then add the tomato paste and saute for another minute or two more. Add the toasted curry powder to the tomato paste mixture, mix well, and then add this to the simmering soup along with the coconut milk and salt. Simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes or so.

Place the olive oil, salt, pepper flakes, and garlic in a pan. Dial the heat up and saute for a minute or two. Add the tomatoes and slowly bring to a simmer as well. Remove from heat, stir in the lemon zest and taste for seasoning. Add more salt if needed. Set aside. Thin out your pasta using a pasta machine. Start by cutting the big sheets into 2-inch(ish) wide ribbons. This usually means making 2 cuts along the sheets. This should yield you about 12 2-foot strips. Run them through the pasta machine. I go to the 7 setting, two shy of the very thinnest setting. The sheets should almost be translucent. Cut the strips into manageable rectangles roughly 4-inches in length. To pre-cook the pasta, fill a large bowl with ice cold water and a few glugs of olive oil. Place a large flour sack or cotton dish towel across one of your counters. Salt your pot of boiling water generously. Ok, now you are ready to boil off your pasta. Believe it or not, you are on the home stretch. Place a handful of the pasta rectangles into the boiling water to cook (I've found I can get away with about 20 at a time), fish them out (I use a spider) after just 15-20 seconds, don't over cook. Transfer them immediately to the cold olive-oil water for a quick swim and cool-off. Remove from the cold water bath and place flat and neat on the cotton towel. It is ok for them to overlap, I don't have a problem with the sheets sticking typically. Repeat until all your pasta is boiled. Ladle a bit of the sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Cover the bottom with a layer of pasta sheets. Now a thin layer of sauce, and a bit of cheese. Go for another layer of pasta, then sauce, then pasta again, then sauce and cheese. Keep going until you've used up all the sauce and pasta. You want to finish with a layer of pasta. Top with the last of the sauce and the very last of the cheese so you have a nice cheesy top. Bake until everything is melted and fragrant, 35 minutes or so. Let it sit for 10 minutes before serving, so everything has a chance to set up a bit. Dust with parmesan and a bit of slivered basil."

192,tlt-sandwich,4.0,-1.0,or 8 extra-thin slices of hearty whole grain bread,35.94,"Whisk together the 3 tablespoons of olive oil, shoyu, balsamic vinegar, brown sugar and adobo sauce. Pour 1/3 of the tempeh marinade into an 8x8 baking dish (or something comparable) - you want a dish that is just big enough to hold the tempeh in a single layer - this way it will be fully enveloped by the marinade. Pour the remaining marinade over the top of the tempeh, cover and keep in the refrigerator for a couple hours, overnight or until ready to use. While the tempeh is marinating, go ahead and roast the tomatoes. Heat the oven to 375F. Cut each tomato in half and arrange them in a large oven-proof baking dish. Mix together the olive oil, sugar, and salt and pour this over the tomatoes. Gently toss them a bit, making sure they all get coated, finishing with each tomato facing cut-side up. Place in the oven and bake for 45 minutes or so, until the tomatoes are shrunken and sweet. When the tempeh is done marinating heat a large pan over medium-high heat and cook the tempeh slices for a few minutes on each side. You may need to do this in batches if you don't have a big enough pan. Set the tempeh slices aside until you are ready to assemble the sandwiches. To assemble each sandwich take one slice of bread and slather a generous layer of mashed avocado. Place a small helping of the shredded lettuce on top of the avocado, a few tomatoes, then a few slices of the tempeh, and more tomatoes. Enjoy either open faced or topped with another avocado-slathered bread slice."

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F (175Â°C), and adjust the oven rack to the top third of the oven. Toss the tomatoes you will be roasting gently (but well) in a bowl along with the olive oil, sugar, and salt. Arrange them in a single layer, cut side up, on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake, without stirring, until the tomatoes shrink a bit and start to caramelize around the edges, 45 to 60 minutes. Set aside to cool."

239,tomato-tart,3.0,-1.0,medium yellow onions,25.520000000000003,"Start by caramelizing your onions. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, combine the onions, olive oil, and a few pinches of salt. Cook stirring regularly for 15-20 minutes or so, or until the onions are dark, deeply caramelized, and jammy in texture. Stir in the turmeric and black pepper, if using, remove from heat, and let cool. If youÛªre making your tart immediately, cool the onions by spreading them across a large plate and placing in the refrigerator. Alternately, if youÛªre baking the next day or two, transfer to a jar and refrigerate. Next up is making the tart dough. If youÛªre used to the typical food processor tart dough method, this is going to be different, but the resulting texture is so much better - flaky perfection. If the instructions are at all confusingåÊyou can watch the method here. I learned the technique from Pim years ago and never looked back. Also, you donÛªt have to wash a food processor = less dishes. To start, mix the flours, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and quinoa in a bowl and turn out onto the counter. Working quickly, cut the butter into four long slabs and arrange in a single layer across the surface of the flour. Hold a bench scraper (or wide metal spatula) in one hand, and use the palm of your other hand to smear the butter into the flour. Use the bench scraper to scrape the smeared flour-butter off the counter and back up into the pile. Use your palm to smear some more, scrape, and repeat. You want lots of feathery flakes throughout the flour. Drizzle the mixture with the ice water and smear, flip, and mix a few more times to bring it all together into a ball. Decide how many tarts youÛªd like to bake, and cut into that many equal pieces (1, 2, or 4). Shape into balls, press into discs, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 45 minutes or over night. You can also double wrap and freeze for up to a month or so at this point, thaw before using. When youÛªre ready to assemble your tart(s), preheat the oven to 400F with a rack in the center.  Roll your dough out into a 1/8-inch thick circle shape on a floured surface, it doesn't have to be perfect. Transfer the rolled out dough to a piece of parchment paper. Arrange a generous amount of the onions in the center of your tart(s) leaving an inch-ish of border. Cover the onions with overlapping sliced tomatoes, then fold the tart dough in toward the filling, over lapping it just a bit. Brush any visible pasty with the beaten egg. Transfer, on the parchment paper, to a baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes or until the crust is deeply golden. Finish with any/all of the suggested ideas - a dusting of cheese, but of lemon zest, lots or basil, definitely go for a drizzle of good olive oil.
